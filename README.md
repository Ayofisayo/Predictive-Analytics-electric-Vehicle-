### 1. High-Performing & Low-Performing Charging Stations:
Analysis:
Stations with more DC fast chargers and earlier open dates recorded higher utilization.
Underperforming stations were typically smaller in size or poorly located.

### 2. Areas with Highest Energy Usage:
Analysis:
Stations with a higher number of chargers and strategic geographic location (urban centers) exhibited higher energy consumption trends.
Predictive modeling (LSTM) showed seasonal energy demand, peaking in summer months.

### 3. Consumer Usage Trends:
Analysis:
Temporal patterns showed increased station usage during specific times of the year.
Locations with higher population density and EV ownership had significantly higher energy usage.

### 4. Demographics & Geographic Trends:
Analysis:
Most EV users were located in urban and suburban regions.
Geographic clustering using K-Means revealed several underserved zones.
These clusters are critical targets for new station development.

### 5. Demand-Supply Gaps:
Analysis:
Cluster analysis showed that while some urban areas had multiple stations, others had high EV registration with little or no infrastructure.
The biggest gap was identified in specific high-density zip codes that showed increasing EV adoption but limited station availability.

### Conclusion and Key Notable Points:
Demand-supply gap exists in key urban/suburban regions.
High-capacity stations with both Level 2 and DC fast chargers perform better.
Location and early operation significantly impact station performance.
LSTM models are effective for demand prediction, aiding in planning.
Cluster-based location strategy helps in identifying optimal areas for new stations.

### Recommendations:
Business Opportunity:
Entrepreneurs should consider developing EV stations in underserved high-demand zones, as identified by cluster models.
Focus should be on stations with a mix of Level 2 and DC fast chargers, which attract more users.
Early market entrants in new EV adoption zones will benefit from first-mover advantages.

### Investment Opportunity:
Anonymous B is advised to invest in data-driven infrastructure planning, supporting companies that use predictive analytics to guide station deployment.
Investment in urban clusters with high predicted growth in EV ownership is ideal.
Backing startups or operators deploying hybrid charging models (Level 2 + DC Fast) will likely offer higher returns.
